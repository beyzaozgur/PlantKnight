### A .NET MAUI Blazor App that detects plant disease

We used Azure Custom Vision service to classify diseases in plants. We have developed 34 different models, each focusing on a specific disease label. The models are based on the One-vs-All technique for multi-class classification. To facilitate the implementation of models and uploading of data, we used  Custom Vision API with python.
