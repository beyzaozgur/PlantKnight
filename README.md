# Plant Knight

### A .NET MAUI Blazor App that detects plant disease

In this project Azure Custom Vision service was used for classification of plant diseases. 34 different models were developed, each focusing on a specific disease label. The models are based on the One-vs-All technique for multi-class classification. To facilitate the implementation of models and uploading of data, Custom Vision API with Python was used.
